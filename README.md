# Earthquake Perception Analysis: Understanding Seismic Concern

## Project Overview

This project explores the perception of earthquakes by analyzing various factors such as stress levels, gender, fear, and demographic details. The aim is to classify seismic concerns among individuals, laying the groundwork for strategic interventions to manage stress during seismic events.

Although the current project focuses solely on classifying seismic concerns, the broader vision involves assisting governments in establishing stress control centers and improving disaster preparedness.

## Features and Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaning and standardizing the dataset.
   - Handling missing and outlier values for accurate modeling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Understanding the distribution of stress and fear metrics.
   - Analyzing relationships between demographic factors and seismic concerns.

3. **Classification Models:**
   - Implemented machine learning algorithms, such as:
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - Naive Bayes
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

4. **Key Objectives:**
   - Identify significant predictors of seismic concern.
   - Classify individuals into different levels of seismic concern.
